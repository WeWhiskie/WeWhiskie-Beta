Subject: Debug & Enhance AI Chatbot – Responses, Whisky Name Generator, Accents & Avatars
Hi Replit Support/AI Assistant,

I'm currently developing an advanced AI chatbot for my whisky-related app, but I'm encountering the following issues and need assistance debugging and improving the system:

1. Chatbot Not Responding Properly
The chatbot either does not respond or takes too long to generate responses.
I need help debugging why it's not replying and optimizing its response time.
I want real-time AI-generated responses that feel engaging and knowledgeable.
2. Implement AI-Generated Whisky Names
I want the chatbot to generate unique whisky names based on parameters like:
Region (e.g., Scottish, Japanese, Australian whisky)
Flavor Profile (e.g., Peaty, Sherried, Spicy, Smooth)
Distillation Style (e.g., Pot Still, Column Still)
Ideally, this feature should integrate with a text-to-image generator for whisky label concepts.
3. Accents & Voice Variations
The chatbot should be able to speak in different accents, such as:
Scottish Highlander
Irish
American Bourbon Distiller
Japanese Whisky Master
Need help implementing Text-to-Speech (TTS) with voice models that match these personas.
4. AI-Generated Avatars
I want dynamically generated AI avatars that:
Match the whisky expert the chatbot is roleplaying.
Can be animated or have facial expressions while speaking.
Use realistic AI art styles to enhance user engagement.
5. Debugging & Optimization Requests
Ensure stable API calls to AI services (GPT, text-to-speech, etc.).
Improve latency for fast, smooth interactions.
Enable multi-turn memory so the chatbot remembers past interactions within a session.
Make sure it works well on mobile and web.
Additional Notes
I'm currently using Replit’s AI tools + OpenAI API for chatbot functionality. If you need access to my repo, let me know what I need to do.

Would appreciate detailed debugging help + guidance on adding these features. Looking forward to your expert input!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
