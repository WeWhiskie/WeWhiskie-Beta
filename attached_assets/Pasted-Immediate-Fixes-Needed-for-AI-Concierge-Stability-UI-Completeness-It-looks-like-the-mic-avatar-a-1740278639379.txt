Immediate Fixes Needed for AI Concierge Stability & UI Completeness
It looks like the mic, avatar, and volume controls are now missing again, which means the latest update may have broken previous progress. Here’s a structured debugging & refinement plan to ensure we get the AI Concierge fully functional, polished, and premium.

🛠️ Immediate Fixes Needed:
1️⃣ Restore & Debug Missing UI Elements
Mic, avatar, and volume controls were visible before but are now gone.
Ensure the component imports and state management are correct.
Check console logs for missing dependencies or rendering issues.
Add error handling so these components don’t silently fail.
🔹 Fix: Verify if the UI elements were unintentionally removed during a merge or overwritten by a recent commit.

2️⃣ Ensure the Avatar Renders Properly
Previously, the avatar had a placeholder but wasn't customizable.
The UI should allow switching avatars (either default options or user-uploaded).
If no avatar is selected, default to Whisky Pete.
🔹 Fix: Ensure the avatar component correctly pulls the selected avatar from state/storage and that it actually renders on the UI.

3️⃣ Reimplement Microphone & Voice Response (TTS)
Clicking the mic should request permission and enable voice input.
The AI Concierge should read responses aloud when responding.
Add a mute button so users can toggle voice output on/off.
🔹 Fix: Confirm speech recognition & TTS APIs are active and calls are properly made when sending and receiving messages.

4️⃣ Make UI Look & Feel Premium
Refine Text Formatting: The concierge’s intro description looks cramped & unpolished.
Add smooth transitions for toggling the mic/avatar.
The chat window needs better spacing & design consistency.
🔹 Fix: Improve padding, fonts, and animations so the whole feature feels polished & high-end.

⏭️ Next Steps
Restore missing mic, avatar, and volume controls.
Ensure avatar rendering + selection works properly.
Verify mic & voice interactions are functional.
Refine chat UI to look premium.
Once these are stable and fully integrated, we can explore advanced features (like dynamic facial expressions, regional accents, and more).

Let’s get this fixed and make it a truly premium whisky AI experience! 🚀
