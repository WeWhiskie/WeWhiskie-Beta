Subject: Enhancing AI Whisky Concierge UI/UX – Elevate the Experience 🚀
Hi Replit Support,

I’m working on making the AI Whisky Concierge the standout feature of my website, but I need help refining the UI/UX to make it feel polished, intuitive, and immersive.

What I Need:
✅ A visually engaging chat interface that feels premium and high-end.
✅ A smooth, intuitive user flow—clients should want to engage with the AI.
✅ Seamless personalization—users should easily select an AI whisky expert with unique traits.
✅ Real-time responses with minimal lag (fast WebSockets integration).
✅ Dynamic visuals & avatars—AI-generated personalities that make the experience immersive.

Vision for the AI Experience
I don’t want this to feel like just another chatbot—I want it to feel like stepping into a high-end whisky bar, where users get personalized recommendations from AI whisky sommeliers.

🔹 AI-Powered Whisky Experts – Users choose from different AI-generated experts, each with a name, backstory, accent, and avatar.
🔹 Real-Time Conversational Flow – Instead of a basic text box, the chat should feel natural, fluid, and engaging.
🔹 Beautiful UI Elements – The chat should feature smooth animations, rich typography, and an elegant color palette that reflects a whisky lounge vibe.
🔹 Audio & Accents (Optional) – If possible, integrate text-to-speech (TTS) so that AI bartenders "speak" in regional accents (Scottish, Irish, Bourbon, Japanese).

What I Need Help With to Achieve This:
1️⃣ Best Frontend UI/UX Framework – Should I use React with TailwindCSS or another modern UI library for a smooth experience?
2️⃣ How to Implement Personality Selection – What’s the best way to let users pick an AI personality (dropdown, carousel, or an interactive selection panel)?
3️⃣ Handling AI Responses Smoothly – Can WebSockets or another method improve response time over traditional API polling?
4️⃣ Dynamic AI Avatars – Are there free or low-cost AI image generation APIs that can create avatars for whisky experts?
5️⃣ Optimizing Chat Performance – What’s the best way to reduce latency and make responses feel instantaneous?

End Goal: A Premium, Immersive AI Whisky Concierge
I want this to feel sleek, premium, and effortless to use. It should be a feature that sells itself—a core part of the website experience that makes users feel like they’re having a personalized whisky tasting with an AI bartender.

Would love any recommendations on UI/UX improvements, frameworks, and best implementation practices to make this a game-changer!
