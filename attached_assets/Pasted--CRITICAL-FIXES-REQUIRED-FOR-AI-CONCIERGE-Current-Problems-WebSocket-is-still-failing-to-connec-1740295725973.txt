🚨 CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED FOR AI CONCIERGE
Current Problems:
❌ WebSocket is still failing to connect – AI Concierge cannot process any real-time interactions.
❌ Avatars are not loading or reacting – No 3D AI avatar displayed.
❌ Voice recognition stops immediately – Speech is not recognized, and no real-time transcription is shown.
❌ AI does not respond with voice – No text-to-speech (TTS) output.
❌ No clear UI indicators for listening, speaking, or errors.
🔹 Step 1: FIX AI CONCIERGE WEBSOCKET CONNECTION
🚨 Issue:

"Connection Error: Failed to connect after multiple attempts."
WebSocket fails to establish a stable connection, causing the AI Concierge to be non-functional.
✅ Solution:

Ensure WebSocket server is properly initialized and listening on the correct port.
Implement automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff (e.g., retry every 2s, then 5s, 10s, etc.).
Debug WebSocket server logs to check for authentication or protocol issues.
Verify that client-side code properly subscribes to WebSocket events (onopen, onmessage, onerror, onclose).
Confirm secure WebSocket (wss://) is used in production instead of insecure ws://.
Expected Fix Confirmation:
✅ WebSocket should establish a stable connection.
✅ Console should show ‘Connected to AI Concierge WebSocket’ upon success.
🔹 Step 2: IMPLEMENT 3D AI AVATARS
🚨 Issue:

Avatar is missing. The UI shows a blank circle instead of a 3D interactive character.
✅ Solution:

Add 3D avatars that dynamically change based on AI personality selection.
Use WebGL/Three.js or Lottie animations to animate the avatar.
The avatar should move its mouth when the AI speaks and react visually to user input.
Store user’s last selected avatar in local storage for persistence.
Expected Fix Confirmation:
✅ Avatar correctly displays based on the selected AI personality.
✅ Avatar moves its mouth when the AI responds.
✅ User can select between different AI avatars.
🔹 Step 3: ENABLE REAL-TIME VOICE RECOGNITION & LIVE TRANSCRIPTION
🚨 Issue:

Voice recognition stops immediately.
No text appears on-screen when speaking.
✅ Solution:

Ensure continuous speech recognition is enabled (recognition.continuous = true).
Implement real-time transcription UI, updating as the user speaks.
Fix microphone permission handling so it properly requests access if needed.
Use the correct language model for accents based on AI personality selection (e.g., UK English for "Highland Expert").
Expected Fix Confirmation:
✅ Speech is recognized and transcribed in real-time.
✅ Transcript appears while speaking.
✅ Microphone permissions request properly if needed.
🔹 Step 4: ENSURE AI RESPONDS WITH VOICE (TEXT-TO-SPEECH)
🚨 Issue:

The AI does not respond vocally—no text-to-speech (TTS) output.
✅ Solution:

Implement Web Speech Synthesis API or ElevenLabs TTS for AI responses.
AI should only speak after fully processing the user’s input to avoid interruptions.
Sync avatar animations to AI speech (mouth moves when speaking).
Expected Fix Confirmation:
✅ AI gives a voice response after processing input.
✅ Avatar moves when AI speaks.
🔹 Step 5: PROVIDE CLEAR UI FEEDBACK FOR SPEAKING/LISTENING
🚨 Issue:

No clear indicator when AI is listening, thinking, or responding.
Mic button is unclear.
✅ Solution:

Replace mic icon with a "speaking person" icon when AI is listening.
Show a pulsing waveform animation when speech is detected.
Display status messages:
🟢 "Listening... Speak clearly into your microphone."
🔵 "Processing..." while AI is thinking.
🟠 "Speaking..." when AI is responding.
Error Handling: If recognition fails, show "Speech Not Detected. Try Again."
Expected Fix Confirmation:
✅ Visual feedback (waveform animation) appears when AI is listening.
✅ Status messages indicate AI states (Listening, Processing, Speaking).
✅ Microphone icon changes to a "speaking" icon while active.
📌 FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE SUBMISSION
✅ WebSocket is fully connected and stable.
✅ 3D avatars load and react to AI responses.
✅ Speech is recognized and transcribed in real-time.
✅ AI responds with voice after processing.
✅ UI clearly indicates listening, processing, and speaking states.
✅ No immediate connection or recognition errors occur.

🎯 Expected Outcome:
The AI Concierge seamlessly recognizes speech, displays live transcription, and responds with a clear voice output while using a 3D animated avatar to enhance the experience.
