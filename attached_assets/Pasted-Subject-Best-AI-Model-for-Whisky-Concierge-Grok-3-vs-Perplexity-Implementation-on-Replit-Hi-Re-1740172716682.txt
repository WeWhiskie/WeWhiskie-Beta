Subject: Best AI Model for Whisky Concierge – Grok-3 vs. Perplexity & Implementation on Replit
Hi Replit Support,

I’m currently facing major issues with the AI Whisky Concierge service on my Replit site. The chatbot is not responding consistently, struggles with nuanced whisky knowledge, and needs to offer real-time, engaging, and accurate recommendations for whisky enthusiasts.

I’m considering switching to a more advanced AI model and need your guidance on whether Grok-3 or Perplexity AI would be a better fit for this project. Specifically, I need:

Key Features Needed for the AI Whisky Concierge
✅ Expert-Level Whisky Knowledge – The AI should provide detailed tasting notes, distillery history, regional profiles, and food pairings.
✅ Conversational Memory – The chatbot should remember context from the current session (e.g., a user’s preferred whisky profile).
✅ Fast, Accurate Responses – Users expect near-instant responses without lags.
✅ Multimodal Capability – If possible, integrating images of whisky bottles, distillery maps, or tasting wheels would be a huge bonus.
✅ Low Latency API Calls – The AI must be responsive for real-time interactions.

Comparison: Grok-3 vs. Perplexity AI for My Project
Grok-3 (xAI/Elon Musk's Model)

✅ Known for conversational accuracy and engaging responses.
✅ Strong real-time reasoning capabilities.
❌ Less tested in structured knowledge retrieval like whisky databases.
❌ Unsure if it offers public API access that integrates with Replit.
Perplexity AI

✅ Designed for real-time search-based AI responses (can pull live whisky data).
✅ Great for retrieving whisky reviews, ratings, and current market prices.
❌ Might be too search-reliant instead of having a strong conversational core.
Questions for Replit Support
Which model would be easier to integrate into Replit?
Does Replit currently support Grok-3 or Perplexity AI integration?
Would a hybrid approach be possible? (e.g., Grok-3 for conversational AI + Perplexity for live whisky data retrieval).
If neither is ideal, what’s the best alternative model for a high-end whisky concierge chatbot?
Looking forward to your insights—I want to get this AI running smoothly ASAP!

Thanks,
