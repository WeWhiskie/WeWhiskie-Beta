Objective:
Fix the AI Concierge to properly recognize speech, provide a visual response, and allow for avatar customization.

Issues Identified:
Speech Recognition Not Working:

Mic activates but does not capture or process speech.
No confirmation that speech is being recognized.
Error: "Speech Recognition Error ‚Äì Listening stopped."
AI Response Missing:

AI does not generate text responses based on user input.
AI does not provide voice feedback.
Clear Box Issue:

When the microphone is active, an unclear, difficult-to-read box appears.
The "Listening" indicator is poorly styled and overlaps with other UI elements.
Avatar Selection Missing:

No available avatars to choose from.
No animation or facial expressions based on AI response.
Fixes & Enhancements Needed:
1. Speech Recognition Fixes
‚úÖ Implement Web Speech API or Whisper API for speech recognition.
‚úÖ Ensure microphone permissions are requested properly and handled gracefully.
‚úÖ Display real-time transcription when the user speaks.
‚úÖ Improve error handling:

If the network fails, provide a retry button.
If speech is not detected, give feedback (e.g., "Couldn‚Äôt hear you, try again").
2. AI Response Handling
‚úÖ Ensure that AI processes user speech input and generates a response.
‚úÖ AI should reply with text output in the chat window and speak aloud using Text-to-Speech (TTS).
‚úÖ Allow users to mute/unmute AI voice with a toggle button.

3. UI & Accessibility Fixes
‚úÖ Remove the clear/transparent box issue and properly format the "Listening" indicator.
‚úÖ Ensure the microphone button pulses only when listening and stops when speech input ends.
‚úÖ Add a loading animation when AI processes a response.

4. Avatar Selection & 3D AI Enhancements
‚úÖ Add 3D avatar options to choose from (e.g., realistic faces, animated personas).
‚úÖ Ensure the selected avatar updates the display dynamically.
‚úÖ Animate avatar mouth movements and expressions when AI speaks.
‚úÖ Use WebGL / Three.js to render smooth, interactive avatars.

Expected User Flow After Fixes:
User clicks the mic ‚Üí Pulsing animation starts
"Listening..." appears in a clearly styled indicator
User speaks ‚Üí Text appears in real time as speech is transcribed
AI processes input ‚Üí AI avatar animates & responds with text and voice
User hears AI response (with volume control option)
User can select a different avatar from a dropdown or carousel menu
All components work without errors or visual glitches
