Subject: Refining AI Whisky Concierge Responses & Implementing Predictive Tasting Profiles
Hi Replit Support,

Thanks for getting the chatbot working! However, the responses are currently too long, and I’d like to refine them while also integrating a personalized AI-powered whisky advisor with predictive tasting profiles.

1️⃣ Issue: Chatbot Responses Are Too Long
🔴 Responses are overly detailed, making them difficult to engage with dynamically.
🔴 Instead of huge blocks of text, responses should be:
✅ Concise and to the point.
✅ Broken into smaller, digestible sections.
✅ If more details are needed, the user can prompt for deeper insights.

✅ Proposed Fix:

Limit response length per message.
Add a “Continue” or “Expand” button to get more details instead of overwhelming the user.
Ensure AI maintains a conversational tone while keeping answers focused & relevant.
2️⃣ Feature Request: AI-Generated "Digital Whisky Concierge" with Predictive Tasting Profiles
I want to expand the AI Concierge into a truly unique and valuable feature—a whisky recommendation engine that learns from the user.

🔹 What It Should Do:
✅ Analyze user preferences based on past selections, reviews, and ratings.
✅ Use AI to predict personalized whisky recommendations based on user tastes.
✅ Incorporate taste-matching AI that understands a user’s palate (e.g., smoky vs. sweet vs. peaty profiles).
✅ Integrate real-world whisky databases to suggest exclusive bottles & investment-worthy whiskies.

🔹 Why It’s Valuable:
✅ Creates a proprietary taste-matching algorithm, making it an IP asset.
✅ Competitively unique—difficult to replicate without exclusive user data.
✅ Potential for licensing to whisky retailers & distilleries, adding a new revenue stream beyond direct consumer sales.

3️⃣ What I Need Help With:
1️⃣ Adjust AI response length to be concise & more interactive.
2️⃣ Store user preferences & taste profiles to build personalized recommendations.
3️⃣ Connect with external whisky databases for exclusive bottle suggestions.
4️⃣ Ensure AI dynamically adjusts recommendations based on evolving user preferences.

Would love to get your help implementing this next-level whisky concierge feature! Let me know the best way to proceed. 🚀🥃

Thanks,
