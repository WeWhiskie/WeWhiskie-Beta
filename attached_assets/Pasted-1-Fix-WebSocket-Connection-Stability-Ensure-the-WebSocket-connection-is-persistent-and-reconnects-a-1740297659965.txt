1. Fix WebSocket Connection Stability
Ensure the WebSocket connection is persistent and reconnects automatically if disconnected.
Implement:
Reconnect logic with exponential backoff to avoid flooding the server.
Session authentication check before sending/receiving data.
Error handling to provide clear messages instead of vague "connection failed" errors.
✅ Check:

Console should log "Connected to AI Concierge WebSocket".
No 401 errors in authentication.
Stable connection should be maintained without requiring a refresh.
2. Ensure Speech Recognition & AI Voice Responses
Fix speech recognition not processing input by verifying:
Microphone permissions are correctly requested & granted.
Live transcription appears on-screen when the user speaks.
Voice output plays AI responses after processing.
Implement:

A real-time waveform animation (pulsing icon or soundwave) when listening.
AI should generate live text transcription below the avatar.
AI voice should respond with synthesized speech (Web Speech API or equivalent).
✅ Check:

When speaking, a real-time transcription appears.
AI responds with voice output after processing input.
Speech recognition does not stop abruptly after activation.
3. Improve UI/UX for Clarity
The speech button should use a "talking person" icon, not a microphone.
AI avatar must be visible and responsive to input.
Button states should be clear:
Idle: Default color.
Listening: Pulsing animation.
Processing: Subtle spinner animation.
✅ Check:

The speech button is now a talking person icon.
Avatar displays correctly and reacts to user input.
UI feedback for active listening and voice response is present.
Expected Final Checks
Before considering the issue resolved, confirm the following:

✅ AI Concierge connects reliably without refresh issues.
✅ WebSocket connection logs ‘Connected to AI Concierge WebSocket’ and remains stable.
✅ Speech recognition detects input, transcribes, and allows a response.
✅ AI voice output works and plays responses.
✅ UI elements are correctly updated, including a talking icon for speech.
Final Confirmation to Replit
Once these fixes are made, confirm functionality by:

Running a full session with multiple voice inputs.
Checking error logs for WebSocket disconnects.
Verifying speech and voice response cycles.
If further issues arise, log specific error codes for faster debugging.
