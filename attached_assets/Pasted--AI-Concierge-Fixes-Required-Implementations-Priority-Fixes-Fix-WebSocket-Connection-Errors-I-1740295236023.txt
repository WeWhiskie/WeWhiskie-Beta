üîß AI Concierge Fixes & Required Implementations
üîπ Priority Fixes
Fix WebSocket Connection Errors
Implement 3D AI Avatars
Enable Real-Time Voice Recognition & Transcription
Ensure AI Voice Responses (Text-to-Speech)
Provide Clear UI Feedback for Speaking/Listening States
1Ô∏è‚É£ FIX WEBSOCKET CONNECTION
üö® Current Issue:

The AI Concierge fails to connect, causing a "Connection Error: Failed to connect to AI Concierge. Retrying..."
This prevents real-time communication, voice recognition, and AI responses.
‚úÖ Solution:

Ensure WebSocket server is correctly configured and running.
Confirm the AI Concierge client is subscribing to the WebSocket server on the correct port and protocol.
Implement proper error handling and reconnection logic (so if the WebSocket disconnects, it properly attempts to reconnect without requiring a full reload).
Test WebSocket stability across multiple sessions.
2Ô∏è‚É£ IMPLEMENT 3D AI AVATARS
üö® Current Issue:

The avatar is missing. The AI Concierge UI does not display the selected avatar or an interactive representation.
‚úÖ Solution:

Add selectable 3D AI avatars (e.g., via a dropdown or carousel).
The avatar should change based on the selected AI personality (e.g., "Highland Expert" should have a distinct appearance).
Use a 3D animated model that can visually react to speech recognition and AI responses (e.g., subtle head movements, lip-syncing to responses).
Store avatar selections in local storage or user profiles so preferences persist.
3Ô∏è‚É£ ENABLE REAL-TIME VOICE RECOGNITION & TRANSCRIPTION
üö® Current Issue:

Voice is NOT being recognized, and no transcription appears.
Recognition stops immediately without capturing speech.
‚úÖ Solution:

Ensure the AI actively listens and transcribes speech in real-time.
Implement continuous recognition mode (recognition.continuous = true).
Add a visible transcription box to display live speech-to-text as the user speaks.
Use Web Speech API or Deepgram/Whisper API for more accurate recognition.
4Ô∏è‚É£ ENSURE AI VOICE RESPONSES (TEXT-TO-SPEECH)
üö® Current Issue:

The AI does NOT respond with voice.
No feedback to indicate the AI is ‚Äúthinking‚Äù or preparing a response.
‚úÖ Solution:

Implement AI-generated voice responses (Text-to-Speech).
Use Web Speech Synthesis API or ElevenLabs AI Voices for realistic responses.
Ensure the AI only speaks after processing user input, not before.
Sync avatar animations to the AI‚Äôs speech (e.g., mouth moves when speaking).
5Ô∏è‚É£ PROVIDE CLEAR UI FEEDBACK FOR SPEAKING/LISTENING STATES
üö® Current Issue:

No visual indicator when the AI is listening.
No way to tell if the system is actively processing speech.
‚úÖ Solution:

Use a speaking animation (waveform or pulsing effect) when the AI is listening.
Update speech recognition button icon to a "speaking person" icon instead of a microphone.
Display "Listening..." or "Processing..." status messages.
Add a loading indicator while AI generates a response.
üìå FINAL TESTING CHECKLIST
For Replit Team: Before Submitting Fixes, Ensure the Following:
‚úÖ WebSocket is connected and stable.
‚úÖ Avatars are loading and reacting to AI responses.
‚úÖ Speech is recognized and transcribed in real-time.
‚úÖ AI provides voice responses with proper timing.
‚úÖ Listening/speaking animations are correctly displayed.
‚úÖ No immediate connection or recognition errors occur.

üéØ Expected Outcome:
The AI Concierge seamlessly recognizes speech, displays live transcription, and responds with a clear voice output while using a 3D animated avatar to enhance the experience.
