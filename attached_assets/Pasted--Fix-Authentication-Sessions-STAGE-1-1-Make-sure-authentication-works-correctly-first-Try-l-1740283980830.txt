🔹 Fix Authentication & Sessions (STAGE 1)
1️⃣ Make sure authentication works correctly first

Try logging in and refreshing → Does it keep you logged in?
Open Developer Console (F12 > Application > Cookies) → Check if the session is stored.
If not, fix express-session:
js
Copy
Edit
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "whisky_secret",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: { secure: false },
  })
);
If req.isAuthenticated() still doesn’t work, debug with:
js
Copy
Edit
console.log("Session:", req.session);
console.log("User:", req.user);
2️⃣ Make sure API calls don’t return errors

Run npm run dev and check the logs.
Open /api/user in the browser. Does it return a valid user object?
3️⃣ Test messaging in the AI Concierge

If messages don’t send, check network logs in DevTools.
If it crashes, fix error handling (try/catch in concierge.js).
🔹 AFTER Authentication is Fixed (STAGE 2)
Once authentication 100% works, move to UI/Feature fixes:

1️⃣ Fix Avatar Rendering

Add a default avatar image (public/avatars/default.png).
In AIConcierge.tsx, set a fallback avatar:
js
Copy
Edit
const [avatar, setAvatar] = useState("/avatars/default.png");
2️⃣ Fix Microphone & Volume Buttons

Make sure react-speech-recognition is installed:
sh
Copy
Edit
npm install react-speech-recognition speech-synthesis
Update AIConcierge.tsx:
js
Copy
Edit
import SpeechRecognition, { useSpeechRecognition } from "react-speech-recognition";
3️⃣ Improve UI Spacing

Adjust .concierge-container in AIConcierge.css:
css
Copy
Edit
.concierge-container {
    max-width: 90%;
    padding: 20px;
    font-size: 16px;
}
4️⃣ How to Keep This Efficient & Cost-Effective
🚀 Test each fix individually before moving to the next issue.
🚀 Keep Replit logs open (npm run dev) to catch errors immediately.
🚀 Only work on one category at a time (avoid mixing authentication fixes with UI changes).
🚀 Use console.log() to verify each fix before assuming it works.
5️⃣ Final Expected Timeline
If followed correctly, this structured plan should:

Fix authentication within 30 minutes ⏳
Fix backend API issues within 15 minutes ⏳
Restore full concierge features (avatars, voice, UI) within 60 minutes ⏳
🔥 After This, You Should Have:
✅ A fully working authentication system
✅ Stable concierge chat with working API calls
✅ A polished, mobile-friendly AI Concierge
✅ Reliable avatars, microphone, and voice responses
