AI Concierge Speech Recognition Fixes & Improvements
Objective:
Fix the speech recognition functionality to ensure that:

The system properly recognizes speech and transcribes it in real-time.
The correct visual feedback is displayed when the AI is actively listening.
The correct icons are used for microphone activation and speech recognition.
No immediate "Voice Recognition Stopped" errors occur after activation.
Required Fixes:
1. Speech Recognition Functionality
When the speech recognition button is clicked, the AI should actively listen for user input and transcribe the speech in real-time.
Ensure Web Speech API/WebKitSpeechRecognition (or any used API) is correctly capturing audio and processing it into text.
The AI should listen continuously until manually stopped or a timeout occurs (e.g., 10-15 seconds of silence).
Fix the issue where speech recognition stops almost immediately after activation.
2. Proper Icons for Controls
Update the speech recognition button icon:

Replace the microphone icon with an industry-standard "speaking person" icon to clearly differentiate it from the microphone toggle button.
Suggested icons:
Material Design "record_voice_over" üéôÔ∏èüë§
FontAwesome "comment-dots" üí¨
Any icon indicating "speaking," NOT just a mic.
Ensure the microphone toggle button (for enabling/disabling microphone access) remains a microphone icon üé§ but does NOT interfere with the speech recognition button.

3. Visual Feedback & UI Behavior
When speech recognition is activated, show live visual feedback to indicate it is listening:
Add a waveform animation (like Siri/Google Assistant) that dynamically responds to voice input.
OR Change the icon color/pulsate while actively listening.
Live transcript display:
Show detected text in real-time.
Text should appear as the user speaks rather than only after they finish.
When speech recognition stops or times out, update the UI:
Display a "Listening Stopped" message only if it actually stops due to inactivity.
Do not show an error immediately after activation.
4. Proper Error Handling
If microphone permissions are not granted, display a clear error message prompting the user to allow access.
If recognition fails (e.g., too much background noise, no speech detected), display an appropriate message like:
"No speech detected. Try speaking again."
"Background noise detected. Please speak clearly."
Do not display "Voice Recognition Stopped" as an error if the user has not spoken yet.
Testing Checklist for Replit
‚úÖ Clicking the speech recognition button properly starts voice recognition.
‚úÖ Speech is transcribed live and displayed on-screen.
‚úÖ Listening animation or icon pulsation works while active.
‚úÖ Error messages only appear if there is an actual issue (not automatically after activation).
‚úÖ No immediate "Voice Recognition Stopped" error after clicking the button.
‚úÖ Speech recognition stops only when manually stopped or after prolonged silence.
‚úÖ Correct icons: "Speaking Person" for speech recognition, Microphone for mic toggle.

Final Notes
If necessary, implement debug logging in the console to catch issues related to speech recognition unexpectedly stopping.
If using Web Speech API, confirm that continuous recognition mode is enabled (recognition.continuous = true).
Ensure that speech transcription works cross-browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari).
By following these steps, the AI Concierge should function as expected with no premature recognition stops, proper UI feedback, and clear error handling.
