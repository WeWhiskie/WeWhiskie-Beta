Current Issues Observed:
WebSocket Connection Failures:

401 authentication errors.
Repeated disconnections and failure to reconnect.
"Connection Lost" and "Failed to connect after multiple attempts" errors persist.
Speech Recognition Not Functioning Properly:

The microphone button does not recognize speech when clicked.
No transcription or live recognition feedback displayed.
The AI does not process or respond to speech input.
User Interface Issues:

The icon for enabling speech recognition is still a microphone instead of a talking user icon.
No real-time animation indicating the system is actively listening.
No AI-generated voice responses.
No visual avatar to indicate which AI personality is active.
Instructions to Fix the AI Concierge:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Fix WebSocket Connection & Authentication Issues
Ensure WebSocket authentication works correctly.
Verify WebSocket stability (no more dropped connections).
Check token authentication flow‚Äîit should request a fresh authentication token if expired.
If WebSocket fails, implement a graceful fallback (retry with backoff mechanism).
Confirm console logs show: "Connected to AI Concierge WebSocket" when successful.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Fix Speech Recognition Issues
Replace the microphone icon with a talking user icon to clearly differentiate its function.
Ensure clicking the icon enables speech recognition.
Prompt users for microphone permissions if needed.
If the mic is disabled, show a clear error message.
Display live transcription as the user speaks.
Words should appear in real-time as detected.
Ensure the AI responds to voice input with text and speech output.
Implement a waveform animation to indicate active listening.
No premature "Voice Recognition Stopped" errors unless manually stopped.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure AI Voice Responses Work
Verify the AI is capable of responding with voice.
Use Text-to-Speech (TTS) API to generate a spoken response.
Implement volume controls for voice output.
AI response should include both text and audio.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Fix Avatar Selection & AI Personality Display
Ensure a 3D avatar appears that matches the selected AI personality.
The avatar should have subtle motion to indicate engagement.
When speaking, the avatar should animate (mouth movement, head nod, etc.).
Allow users to select from multiple AI avatars.
5Ô∏è‚É£ UI & Error Handling Improvements
Improve all error messages to be more user-friendly.
Ensure the UI clearly indicates the AI's state (Listening, Thinking, Responding).
Fix any transparent or misplaced UI elements.
Test across different devices and browsers to ensure full compatibility.
‚úÖ Expected Outcome:
‚úÖ WebSocket authentication works flawlessly with no disconnects.
‚úÖ Speech recognition properly captures and transcribes voice input.
‚úÖ AI processes and responds with both text and voice output.
‚úÖ 3D avatars are working and animate based on interaction.
‚úÖ Clear user interface with proper icons, animations, and error handling.
üí° Once these are fixed, please verify everything works correctly before deploying.
If any issues persist, provide detailed console logs and error messages for further debugging.
