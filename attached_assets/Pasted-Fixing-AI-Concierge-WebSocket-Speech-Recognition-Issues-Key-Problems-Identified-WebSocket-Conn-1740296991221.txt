Fixing AI Concierge WebSocket & Speech Recognition Issues
üî¥ Key Problems Identified:
WebSocket Connection Fails (401 Authentication Errors)

Connection repeatedly drops ("Connection Lost," "Failed to connect after multiple attempts").
Authentication errors (401) indicate token issues or session validation problems.
WebSocket does not re-establish connection properly after failures.
Speech Recognition Still Not Working

No transcription appears when speaking.
No voice responses from AI.
No live listening feedback (e.g., waveform animation).
Speech recognition stops immediately after activation (error messages follow).
UI Issues & Missing Features

No animated 3D avatar (should reflect the AI personality).
Speaking icon still incorrect (should not be a microphone).
No visible animation when the AI is "thinking" or "responding."
‚úÖ Action Plan for Replit ‚Äì Step-by-Step Fixes
1Ô∏è‚É£ WebSocket Connection ‚Äì Fix Authentication & Stability
Ensure WebSocket uses a valid authentication token.
Refresh authentication token if expired (don't disconnect).
Verify WebSocket handshake request is correct (check headers).
Implement auto-reconnect logic (with exponential backoff).
Debug WebSocket console logs:
Should show "Connected to AI Concierge WebSocket" (no errors).
Ensure server accepts & validates tokens properly.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Fix Speech Recognition & AI Response
Replace microphone icon with a talking user icon (more intuitive).
When activated:
Prompt user for microphone permissions (if needed).
Display live transcription as words are recognized.
Show waveform animation while listening.
Ensure AI processes input and responds with:
Text response (chat bubble).
Voice response (TTS with volume control).
Fix premature speech recognition stop (errors like "Listening stopped").
Only stop when user clicks stop, not on timeout.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Add AI Avatar & Animation
Ensure 3D avatar is displayed based on selected AI personality.
Animate avatar when speaking (mouth moves, subtle expressions).
Add ‚ÄòThinking‚Äô animation when processing.
Allow users to select avatar styles.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Improve UI & Error Handling
Ensure all error messages explain what went wrong & how to fix it.
No transparent/overlapping UI elements.
Fix any scaling issues on mobile.
Test across different browsers.
üîç Final Checklist for Replit
‚úÖ WebSocket is stable, properly authenticated, and auto-reconnects.
‚úÖ Speech recognition is functional & continuously listens.
‚úÖ AI responds in both text & voice.
‚úÖ Avatar is present, animates, and matches personality.
‚úÖ UI is clean, with clear indicators for AI states.
üí° Once fixed, confirm all functionality works correctly before deployment. If issues persist, provide logs for debugging.
